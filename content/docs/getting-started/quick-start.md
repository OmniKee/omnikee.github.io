# Opening a database

On the start page of the application, you can pick a KeePass 2.x `.kdbx` file to load by clicking into the "Database" field. You can optionally provide a password and a key file that should be used to unlock the database.

Click "Open" to attempt decrypting the database.

You should now see the database overview page. Select a group in the left panel to see the entries that belong to that group in the right panel.

Double-click on an entry to explore more details.
